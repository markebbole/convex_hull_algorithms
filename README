There are 3 different modes and you can cycle between them by pressing D.

Mode 1: 2D points
Mode 2: 3D points
Mode 3: Input geometry

There are several commands:

G: generate a new set of random points
H: generate the convex hull
X: Zoom in
Z: Zoom out
P: Create a new point where the mouse is positioned
Space: Erase all points
